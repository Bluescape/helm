If IRSA is not properly set up, this controller will not be able to authenticate with AWS
certificate manager or AWS secrets manager. Please see the documentation for how to set
that up.

Please take a look at the certificate-manager-sample.yaml file to learn how to properly
annotate the cert-manager certificate manifest correctly for secrets to inherit the
correct annotations for cert-manager-sync to properly sync them to AWS.

Note that this tool is a run candidate (beta) and may need bugfixes. Please report
any bugs to the Bluescape SRE team by creating a Jira ticket to the SRE project.
